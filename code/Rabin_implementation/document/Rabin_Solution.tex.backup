{\textbf {Problem Objective:}} According to our last discussion, I have tried to model the solution in such
a way so that it can be solved by Rabin's acceptance condition. In case of buchi 
automata, we have drawn the possible sequence with the control states and selected 
them who were exponentially stable. But exponential stability can be calculated if
the states are represented by matrices. Here I have considered automata to represent
control loops, so we cannot apply exponential stability as an acceptance condition.

To model such a situation, I have used Rabin's tree acceptance condition. How I can
use it, I have explained later on.

{\textbf{System Description: }}In the above diagram there are two control loops sharing a common bus. From control loop1, 
$q_2$ and $q_3$ states are sharing the bus and from control loop2 $p_0$
is also sharing the bus. So these three states are sharing the bus. 

{\textbf{Solution methods: }}There are $L^n$ sequences possible for scheduling the bus access with $n$ states.
Now for 3 length sequence with 3 states the possible combinations are $3^3 = 27$ 
sequences. The tree automata for the above states can be represented as follows

A Rabin automaton on $\sum$-trees is a tuple $A = (Q, qo, \sigma, T)$ where $Q$ is a nonempty finite
set of states, $q_0 \epsilon Q$ (the initial state), $\sigma \subseteq Q \times \sum \times Q \times Q$
(the set of transitions), and $T = \{(L1, U1), . . . , (LN, UN)\} $ where $Li, Ui \subseteq Q$
(the collection of accepting pairs of states).

\noindent
Now if I define Acceptance condition for the above tree as $T = \{(q_2, q_3), (\phi, p_0)\}$.
So from the above tree those paths will be accepted which do not have $q_2$. Removing all sequences
which have $q_2$ as one of their states, we have the remaining sequences  with only states $q_3$ and $p_0$.


With these remaining states, we can construct the state transition table, that we have done earlier,
will find a cycle, the state alphabets will comprise of these two states.

Now consider that Control loop 1 is got replaced and has now the construct depicted in Fig. 3.

In the above diagram, $q_3$ from control loop 1 is not sharing the bus, only $q_2$ is 
sharing. But now if we draw the tree automata, and tried to apply Rabin's Acceptance
condition that we have considered, then we will find that only $p_0p_0p_0$ will be 
the only remaining state.
