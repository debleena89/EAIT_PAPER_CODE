To explain our problem we are considerig a system consisting of many control
applications. Each of these control applications is partitioned into a set of
tasks. Each of these tasks are mapped onto different processors. These tasks 
of the controllers communicates via shared buses. The tasks on each processors
are scheduling using a given scheduling policy. The messages on the shared buses
are also scheduled using a given arbitration policy.

we will use the term platform to refer to such an (i) architecture (ii) the 
different scheduling and arbitration policies used.
