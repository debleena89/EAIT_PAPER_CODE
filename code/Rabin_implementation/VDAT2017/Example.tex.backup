\section{Illustrative examples} \label{sec5}

In this section we illustrate our approach considering the example given in Fig.2.
Three control applications are sharing the bus , only the bus accessing are represented in 
the diagram. According to the steps given in the solution architecture section we constructed the automaton.
Here we have 6 states competing for the bus access from three control applications. If we choose the length
of the control schedule length to be $3$ then we have $6^3 = 216$ number of sequneces. The way the tree can be
formed is depicted in the Fig.

The leaf nodes represents the state for the B\"{u}chi automaton. Each path of the tree 
represents one possible scheduling sequence. The leaf node represents the sequence when they
take part in B\"{u}chi automaton construction.
